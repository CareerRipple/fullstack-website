# Developer Instructions

### As of 9/10 "docker-compose up" is not yet functional. 
### Continue to run thing locally by pulling from main, and activating virtual environment: 
```
venv\scripts\activate  
```
for Windows, look it up the command for Mac.
### Running Backend:
cd into Backend folder then run:
```
python manage.py runserver 
```
then view at localhost:8000
### Running Frontend:
 cd into Frontend folder then run:
 
 ``` 
 npm run dev 
 ```
 then view at localhost:5173

### Nginx: It mostly linux compatible so it won't run on non-linux machine until I get docker running.
